# GuessingGame

This is a simple but effective example of using interactive JS code that can not only entertain you, but also test your intuition.

Rules:
The computer guesses a number in the numerical range specified in the settings, and the user tries to guess it by entering a number in the input field. When you enter a number, hints appear in the form of HIGHER or LOWER arrows that light up until the number is guessed.

P.S. Maybe this is not the coolest and most beautiful code or example that you have seen before, but this example helped me to go a little deeper into native JS development, but I promise that this is just the beginning of my adventures in development.
